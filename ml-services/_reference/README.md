# Features

## Machine Learning Pipeline

The project includes:

- Iris dataset loading
- RandomForestClassifier training
- Model evaluation
- MLflow experiment tracking
- Parameter logging
- Metric logging
- Model registration
- Production model promotion
- BentoML deployment


## Model Lifecycle

Production workflow:

```
Train Model
     |
     v
Register Model
     |
     v
Staging Alias
     |
     v
Validation
     |
     v
Production Alias
     |
     v
API Serving
```

Example:

```
Version 1
    |
 @production


Retraining

Version 2
    |
 @staging


After validation

Version 2
    |
 @production
```

The prediction service automatically loads:

```
models:/iris_classifier@production
```

No code changes are required when a new production model is promoted.


## Production Promotion Gate

Only models meeting the configured accuracy threshold are promoted to the
`@production` alias.

```python
PROMOTION_ACCURACY_THRESHOLD = 0.85

## BentoML ML Service Improvements

### Completed Tasks

### 1. Health Check Improvements
- Improved `/health` endpoint.
- Added real model validation using canary prediction.
- Added prediction probability check to verify model integrity.
- Health check now detects model loading issues and class mismatch problems.

---

### 2. Batch Validation Improvements
- Added batch input validation.
- Implemented custom field validation to detect invalid/ragged feature lists.
- Improved error handling for incorrect input formats.

---

### 3. Model Version Promotion Workflow Review
- Reviewed MLflow model lifecycle workflow.
- Identified issue where staging models were directly promoted to production.
- Planned separation between:
  - Model training
  - Staging approval
  - Production promotion
  -  Models with accuracy >= 0.85 are promoted to production.
  - The threshold can be changed in config.py.
  - PROMOTION_ACCURACY_THRESHOLD = 0.85


---

### 4. Latency Metrics Fix
- Fixed batch latency calculation issue.
- Separated:
  - Single prediction latency
  - Batch prediction latency
- Improved `/metrics` endpoint reporting accuracy.

---

### 5. Performance Benchmarking
Compared loop inference vs batch inference.

Result:
using  150 samples from the Iris dataset
| Method | Time |
|---|---:|
| Loop Prediction | 4009.16 ms |
| Batch Prediction | 34.09 ms |

Speedup = Loop Prediction Time / Batch Prediction Time

Speedup = 4009.16 / 34.09

Speedup = 117.61x

Batch inference improvement:

**117.61x speedup**

---



## Pending Improvements

## Future Improvements

- Manual approval workflow before production promotion
- CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
- Model drift monitoring with Evidently AI
- Automated retraining pipeline
- Docker Compose deployment

# Work Completed - 10-08-2026

## MLflow Compatibility and Model Lifecycle Fixes

The required MLflow compatibility and model lifecycle changes have been
implemented and verified.

### Completed Changes

- Replaced `datetime.UTC` usage with `timezone.utc` for promotion timestamps.
- Added `_set_alias()` helper for MLflow model alias management.
- Added support for `set_registered_model_alias()`.
- Added fallback support for `transition_model_version_stage()`.
- Updated `assign_staging()` to use `_set_alias()`.
- Updated `promote_model()` to use `_set_alias()`.
- Added a guard when the source alias does not contain a model version.
- Updated `get_model_version_by_alias()` to consistently return:
  - Model version string when the alias exists.
  - `None` when the alias does not exist.
- Updated `MODEL_STAGE` configuration to use lowercase:
  `production`.
- Removed the outdated commented test block.
- Verified that the project has no import errors.

### MLflow Version Verification

Current installed MLflow version:

```text
MLflow 3.4.0

set_registered_model_alias: True
transition_model_version_stage: True
